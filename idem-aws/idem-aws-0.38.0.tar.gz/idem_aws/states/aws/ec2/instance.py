    """Launches an instance using an AMI for which you have permissions.

    You can specify a number of options, or leave the default options.

    The following rules apply:

        - [EC2-VPC] If you don't specify a subnet ID, we choose a default subnet from your default VPC for you.
            If you don't have a default VPC, you must specify a subnet ID in the request.
        - [EC2-Classic] If don't specify an Availability Zone, we choose one for you.
            Some instance types must be launched into a VPC.
            If you do not have a default VPC, or if you do not specify a subnet ID, the request fails.
            For more information, see Instance types available only in a VPC.
        - [EC2-VPC] All instances have a network interface with a primary private IPv4 address.
            If you don't specify this address, we choose one from the IPv4 range of your subnet.
            Not all instance types support IPv6 addresses.
            For more information, see Instance types.
        - If you don't specify a security group ID, we use the default security group.
            For more information, see Security groups.
        - If any of the AMIs have a product code attached for which the user has not subscribed, the request fails.
        - You can create a launch template, which is a resource that contains the parameters to launch an instance.
            You can specify the launch template instead of specifying the launch parameters.
            An instance is ready for you to use when it's in the running state.
        - You can tag instances and EBS volumes during launch, after launch, or both.
        - Linux instances have access to the public key of the key pair at boot.
            You can use this key to provide secure access to the instance.
            Amazon EC2 public images use this feature to provide secure access without passwords.
            For more information, see Key pairs.

            * NetworkInterfaceId (str, Optional):
                The ID of the network interface. If you are creating a Spot Fleet, omit this parameter because
                you can’t specify a network interface ID in a launch specification.

            * PrivateIpAddress (str, Optional):
                The private IPv4 address of the network interface. Applies only if creating a network interface
                when launching an instance. You cannot specify this option if you're launching more than one

            * PrivateIpAddresses (list[dict[str, Any]], Optional):
                One or more private IPv4 addresses to assign to the network interface. Only one private IPv4
                address can be designated as primary. You cannot specify this option if you're launching more
                than one instance in a RunInstances request.

                * Primary (bool, Optional):
                    Indicates whether the private IPv4 address is the primary private IPv4 address. Only one IPv4

                than one private IP address using the private IP addresses option. You cannot specify this
                option if you're launching more than one instance in a RunInstances request.

            * SubnetId (str, Optional):
                The ID of the subnet associated with the network interface. Applies only if creating a network
                interface when launching an instance.

            * AssociateCarrierIpAddress (bool, Optional):
                Indicates whether to assign a carrier IP address to the network interface. You can only assign a
                carrier IP address to a network interface that is in a subnet in a Wavelength Zone. For more
                information about carrier IP addresses, see Carrier IP addresses in the Amazon Web Services
                Wavelength Developer Guide.

            * InterfaceType (str, Optional):
                The type of network interface. Valid values: interface | efa.

                If you are using RequestSpotInstances to create Spot Instances, omit this parameter because you
                can’t specify the network card index when using this API. To specify the network card index, use
                RunInstances.

            * Ipv4Prefixes (list[dict[str, Any]], Optional):
                One or more IPv4 delegated prefixes to be assigned to the network interface. You cannot use this

        capacity_reservation_specification(dict[str, Any], Optional):
            Information about the Capacity Reservation targeting option. If you do not specify this
            parameter, the instance's Capacity Reservation preference defaults to open, which enables it to
            run in any open Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes (instance type, platform,
            Availability Zone). Defaults to None.

            * CapacityReservationPreference (str, Optional):
                Indicates the instance's Capacity Reservation preferences.
                Possible preferences include:

                * open:
                    The instance can run in any open Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes (instance
                    type, platform, Availability Zone).

                * none:
                    The instance avoids running in a Capacity Reservation even if one is available. The instance runs as an On-Demand Instance.

            * CapacityReservationTarget (dict[str, Any], Optional):
                Information about the target Capacity Reservation or Capacity Reservation group.

                * CapacityReservationId (str, Optional):
                    The ID of the Capacity Reservation in which to run the instance.

                * CapacityReservationResourceGroupArn (str, Optional):
                    The ARN of the Capacity Reservation resource group in which to run the instance.

        client_token(str):
            The idempotency token for the instance.

        root_device_name(str):
            The device name of the root device (for example, /dev/sda1).

        product_codes(list[dict[str, str]]:
            The product codes attached to the instance, if applicable.

        reservation_id(str):
            The ID of the reservation

        block_device_mappings(list[dict[str, Any]], Optional):
            The block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to
            the instance at launch. For more information, see Block device mappings in the Amazon EC2 User
            Guide. Defaults to None.

            * DeviceName (str, Optional):
                The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh).

            * VirtualName (str, Optional):
                The virtual device name (ephemeralN). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An
                instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ephemeral0 and
                ephemeral1. The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After
                you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume. NVMe instance store volumes are
                automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping
                has no effect. Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the
                block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance
                store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

                Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched.

                * DeleteOnTermination (bool, Optional):
                    Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see
                    Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

                * Iops (int, Optional): The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3, io1, and io2 volumes,
                    this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this
                    represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O
                    credits for bursting. The following are the supported values for each volume type:
                    gp3: 3,000-16,000 IOPS    io1: 100-64,000 IOPS    io2: 100-64,000 IOPS   For io1 and io2 volumes,
                    we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for Instances built on the Nitro System. Other instance families
                    guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS. This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes.
                    The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is not supported for gp2, st1, sc1, or
                    standard volumes.

                * SnapshotId (str, Optional):
                    The ID of the snapshot.

                * VolumeSize (int, Optional):
                    The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you
                    specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume size that is
                    equal to or larger than the snapshot size. The following are the supported volumes sizes for
                    each volume type:    gp2 and gp3:1-16,384    io1 and io2: 4-16,384    st1 and sc1: 125-16,384
                    standard: 1-1,024.

                * VolumeType (str, Optional):
                    The volume type. For more information, see Amazon EBS volume types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.
                    If the volume type is io1 or io2, you must specify the IOPS that the volume supports.

                * KmsKeyId (str, Optional):
                    Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN) for a customer managed CMK under which the
                    EBS volume is encrypted. This parameter is only supported on BlockDeviceMapping objects called
                    by RunInstances, RequestSpotFleet, and RequestSpotInstances.

                * Throughput (int, Optional):
                    The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s. This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.
                    Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000.

                * OutpostArn (str, Optional):
                    The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is stored. This parameter is only supported on
                    BlockDeviceMapping objects called by  CreateImage.

                * Encrypted (bool, Optional):
                    Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a
                    backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume
                    origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by
                    default is enabled. For more information, see Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EC2 User
                    Guide. In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume. Encrypted volumes can only
                    be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see Supported
                    instance types. This parameter is not returned by DescribeImageAttribute.

            * NoDevice (str, Optional): To omit the device from the block device mapping, specify an empty string. When this property is
                specified, the device is removed from the block device mapping regardless of the assigned value.

        license_arns(list[str]):
            The license configuration arns.

            interruption behavior is either hibernate or stop.

        block_duration_minutes(int):
            Deprecated.

        valid_until(str):
            The end date of the request, in UTC format (YYYY -MM -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z). Supported only for persistent requests.

            The number of threads per CPU core. To disable multithreading for the instance, specify a value of1 .
            Otherwise, specify the default value of 2.

        http_tokens(str):
            The state of token usage for your instance metadata requests. If the state is optional, you can
            choose to retrieve instance metadata with or without a signed token header on your request. If
            you retrieve the IAM role credentials without a token, the version 1.0 role credentials are
            returned. If you retrieve the IAM role credentials using a valid signed token, the version 2.0
            role credentials are returned. If the state is required, you must send a signed token header
            with any instance metadata retrieval requests. In this state, retrieving the IAM role
            credentials always returns the version 2.0 credentials; the version 1.0 credentials are not
            available. Default: Optional.

        http_put_response_hop_limit(int):

            Enables or disables the IPv6 endpoint for the instance metadata service.

        metadata_tags_enabled(bool):
            Set to enabled to allow access to instance tags from the instance metadata. Set to disabled to
            turn off access to instance tags from the instance metadata. For more information, see Work with
            instance tags using the instance metadata. Default: disabled.

        hostname_type(str):
            The type of hostname for EC2 instances.
            For IPv4 only subnets, an instance DNS name must be based on the instance IPv4 address.
