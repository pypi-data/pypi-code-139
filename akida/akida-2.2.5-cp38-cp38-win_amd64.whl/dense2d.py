class Dense2D(Layer):
    """Dense layer capable of working on 2D inputs.

    The 2D Dense operation is simply the repetition of a 1D
    FullyConnected/Dense operation over each input row.
    Inputs shape mush be in the form (1, X, Y). Being the result of a quantized
    operation, it is possible to apply some shifts to adjust the inputs/outputs
    scales to the equivalent operation performed on floats, while maintaining
    a limited usage of bits and performing the operations on integer values.

    The 2D Dense operation can be described as follows:

    ```python
    inputs = inputs << input_shift
    prod = matmul(inputs, weights) * weights_scale
    prod = prod << prod_shift
    bias = bias << bias_shift
    output = prod + bias
    output = output >> output_shift
    ```

    Inputs shape must be (1, X, Y). Note that output values will be saturated
    on the range that can be represented with output_bits.

    Args:
        units (int): Positive integer, dimensionality of the output space.
        weights_bits (int, optional): number of bits used to quantize weights.
        weights_scale_bits (int, optional): number of bits used to quantize
            weights scales.
        bias_bits (int, optional): number of bits used to quantize bias.
        output_bits (int): output bitwidth.
        buffer_bits (int): buffer bitwidth.
        name (str, optional): name of the layer.
