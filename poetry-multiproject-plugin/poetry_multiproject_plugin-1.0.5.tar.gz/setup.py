You will now be able to share code between projects.\n\nAn suggested Monorepo structure, with the shared code extracted into a separate folder structure:\n\n``` shell\nprojects/\n  my_app/\n    pyproject.toml (including a shared package)\n\n  my_service/\n    pyproject.toml (including other shared packages)\n\nshared/\n  my_namespace/\n    my_package/\n      __init__.py\n      code.py\n\n    my_other_package/\n      __init__.py\n      code.py\n```\n',
